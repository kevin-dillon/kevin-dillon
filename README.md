### Hi, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm a junior at Cal State Fullerton studying Computer Science. I'm expected to graduate in May 2022. During Summer 2020, I was an intern at Berkeley Lab (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). Next summer, I will be joining Bank of America as a software engineering intern.
