### Hi, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm a senior at Cal State Fullerton studying Computer Science. I'm expected to graduate in May 2022.

During Summer 2021, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Bank of America through their Global Technology Summer Analyst Program. During Summer 2020, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Berkeley Lab.
